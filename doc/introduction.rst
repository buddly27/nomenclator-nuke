Nomenclator is a plugin for :term:`Nuke`, :term:`Nuke Studio` and :term:`Hiero` to save a
composition (.nk) or project (.hrox) scene and manage render outputs following a specific
naming convention based on the folder structure.

How does it work?
=================

Descriptive and consistent file names are an important part of organizing, sharing, and
keeping track of data files. File naming can be tedious and error prone, so it is
often a good idea to automate the process.

However, naming conventions are often based on elements that are specific to a project.
It would not make sense to adopt a similar convention for an episodic program and a commercial.
On top of that, studios often request a strict naming convention for content delivery, so a rigid
automation can be hard to adjust and maintain.

The goal of this plugin is to provide a configurable way to define naming conventions
based on the folder structure.
